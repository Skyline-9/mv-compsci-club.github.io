        <h3>The Biggest And Best Tech Club of MV</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><b>MV Computer Science</b> is, to put it bluntly, the above. Founded in 2007 as MV Java Club, MVCS (rebranded in 2013) has expanded from teaching the Java programming language to embracing the arts that are computer science, coding, and the integration of both into technologies that make our life tick.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Today, we cover topics as varied as algorithmic programming (to prep for competitions like <a href="htttp://usaco.org">USACO</a>) to teaching computer science from a top-down perspective, and even web programming for educational nonprofits like <a href="http://www.learntobe.org/">Learn To Be</a>.</p>
        </br>
        <p>We hope to not only promote tech-literacy, but also empower teens, young adults, and students to take up pursuits (and maybe even careers!) in technology. We have a lot of exciting stuff going on, and it's only going to get better from here</p>
        </br>
        <h5>And we want you to be part of the journey. <a href="members.html?f=s">Sign up here.</a></h5>

        <br><br>
        His interests in programming are wide - including game development, AI, image processing, server/client apps, and much more. Some of his works involve genetic algorithms, multi-agent path-finding, and using image processing to track moving biological cells in videos.
        <br><br>
        Some other subjects of interest to Ajay are Literature and French! As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, he's only a part-time nerd. Or tries to be.
