        <h3>The Biggest And Best Tech Club of MV</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><b>MV Computer Science</b> is, to put it bluntly, the above. Founded in 2007 as MV Java Club, MVCS (rebranded in 2013) has expanded from teaching the Java programming language to embracing the arts that are computer science, coding, and the integration of both into technologies that make our life tick.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Today, we cover topics as varied as algorithmic programming (to prep for competitions like <a href="htttp://usaco.org">USACO</a>) to teaching computer science from a top-down perspective, and even web programming for educational nonprofits like <a href="http://www.learntobe.org/">Learn To Be</a>.</p>
        </br>
        <p>We hope to not only promote tech-literacy, but also empower teens, young adults, and students to take up pursuits (and maybe even careers!) in technology. We have a lot of exciting stuff going on, and it's only going to get better from here</p>
        </br>
        <h5>And we want you to be part of the journey. <a href="members.html?f=s">Sign up here.</a></h5>

        <h3>Ajay Gopinath (President)</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Ajay is currently a senior at MV, and enjoys programming and solving problems (of almost any kind!) . He programs mainly in Java and MATLAB, but is familiar with PHP, HTML/JS/CSS and Flash/Flex/AS3 as well. 
        <br><br>
        His interests in programming are wide - including game development, AI, image processing, web apps, and much more. Some of his works include the problem of optimization, path-finding, and applying computers to solve problems in other scientific domains.
        <br><br>
        Some other subjects of interest to Ajay are Literature and French! As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, he's only a part-time nerd. Or tries to be.

        <h3>Isabelle Ju (Director of Tech)</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Isabelle is a junior at MV.  She programs in Java, but knows a bit of C++.  
        <br><br>
        While not on the computer, Isabelle likes to sleep. She also likes to play Connect 4 and look at pictures of cats and cuttlefish.  She also enjoys making paper airplanes, but has yet to build one that actually flies well.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Carol Wang (Director of Tech)</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Carol is currently a sophomore (suffermore) and loves a hodgepodge of things. To name a few, she loves yellow and purple (unintentional school spirit), pandas, fluffy unicorns, a wide range of music, and FOOD. 
        <br><br>
        She is proficient in Java, but is continuously learning C++, HTML 5/CSS, Javascript, and PHP. Carol is also very interested in making iOS and Android applications and wants to make her own game someday (hopefully soon :P). 
        <br><br>
        In addition to computer programming, she also dedicates a lot of time to violin and has been playing for quite a long time now. Carol also participates in speech tournaments and is in the Speech and Debate club (YAY!). If she really has extra time, she likes to read about random current events, philosophies, and astrophysics.

        <h3>Nikhil Cheerla (USACO Day lead)</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Nikhil Cheerla is a sophomore in Monta Vista high school. Nikhil started coding when when was in 6th grade and enjoyed it from the beginning. To Nikhil, programming is a hobby, and a way to relax. 
        <br><br>       
        Nikhil likes to solve hard computer science problems that involve complex algorithms. He participates in USACO and is a gold level contestant there. He started USACO training in the Java Club to spread his knowledge about computational problems and to raise awareness of algorithms. Nikhil likes to teach and learn as he teaches.
        <br><br>
        In his free time, he plays tennis, reads books, does mock hackathons with his friends and tries to think of crazy ideas for apps.

        <h3>When does the club meet?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>MVCS is divided into branches, which meet on different days/times of the week. Check out the <a href="branches.html">branches</a> page to learn more. Attendance to all meetings is not necessary.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>What sort of experience is needed?</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul align="left">
            <li><p>For <em>Lecture Days</em>, none at all! Come in, even if you don't know programming, to learn from a top-down fashion the logical/algorithmic basis behind many useful data structures, algorithms, and technologies.</p></li>
            <li><p>For <em>Creative Days</em>, web development experience is useful, and may be necessary depending on your role. Come and ask us (via email or in person) for more information relating to whether you might be able to help out.</p></li>
            <li><p>For <em>USACO Training Days</em>, experience in algorithms and some data structures would be useful, as well as a moderate grasp of basic Java data structures like arrays, Lists, etc. Again, inquire further to see if the fit is right!</p></li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>Why should I sign up?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Having an account gives you access to member-specific information, like viewing upcoming meetings, being able to "check in" to meetings to show you were there and get points in the process, and generally officiating your status as a member.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>What are points?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Points are a recent addition to the MVCS system, where we want to keep track of member participation in the club. They will be considered when evaluating officer applications at the end of the year, and for designating member privileges and roles within branches as well.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Points are (for now) gained through regular member attendance to meetings and by "checking in" by logging into the site when you're at the meeting. Another reason to <a href="members.html?f=s">sign up</a>now!</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>How do I become an officer?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Officer applications will be sent out at the end of each school year. Factors considered when choosing officers are member attendance, participation in the meetings, and a holistic evaluation (by the entire officer team). Interviews for candidates will be conducted as well.</p>
