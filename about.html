        <h3>The Biggest And Best Tech Club of MV</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><b>MV Computer Science</b> is, to put it bluntly, the above. Founded in 2007 as MV Java Club, MVCS (rebranded in 2013) has expanded from teaching the Java programming language to embracing the arts that are computer science, coding, and the integration of both into technologies that make our life tick.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, we cover topics as varied as algorithmic programming (to prep for competitions like <a href="usaco.org">USACO</a>) to teaching computer science from a top-down perspective, and even web programming for educational nonprofits like <a href="http://www.learntobe.org/">Learn To Be</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We hope to not only promote tech-literacy, but also empower teens, young adults, and students to take up pursuits (and maybe even careers!) in technology. We have a lot of exciting stuff going on, and it's only going to get better from here</p>
        <br>
        <h5>And we want you to be part of the journey. <a href="https://mailchi.mp/d00df54ef74b/hbzlk1mg17">Sign up here.</a></h5>

        <h3>When does the club meet?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>MVCS meets on Wednesdays during lunch, and the competitive division (if you're interested in ACSL!) meets on Fridays during lunch. Attendance to all meetings is not necessary.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>What sort of experience is needed?</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul align="left">
            <li><p>For <em>Lecture Days</em>, none at all! Come in, even if you don't know programming, to learn from a top-down fashion the logical/algorithmic basis behind many useful data structures, algorithms, and technologies.</p></li>
            <li><p>For <em>Creative Days</em>, web development experience is useful, and may be necessary depending on your role. Come and ask us (via email or in person) for more information relating to whether you might be able to help out.</p></li>
            <li><p>For <em>USACO Training Days</em>, experience in algorithms and some data structures would be useful, as well as a moderate grasp of basic Java data structures like arrays, Lists, etc. Again, inquire further to see if the fit is right!</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why should I sign up?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Having an account gives you access to member-specific information, like viewing upcoming meetings, being able to "check in" to meetings to show you were there and get points in the process, and generally officiating your status as a member.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>What are points?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Points are a recent addition to the MVCS system, where we want to keep track of member participation in the club. They will be considered when evaluating officer applications at the end of the year, and for designating member privileges and roles within branches as well.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Points are (for now) gained through regular member attendance to meetings and by "checking in" by logging into the site when you're at the meeting. Another reason to <a href="https://mailchi.mp/d00df54ef74b/hbzlk1mg17">sign up</a> now!</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>How do I become an officer?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Officer applications will be sent out at the end of each school year. Factors considered when choosing officers are member attendance, participation in the meetings, and a holistic evaluation (by the entire officer team). Interviews for candidates will be conducted as well.</p>
